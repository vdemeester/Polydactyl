# polydactly â€” random cat generator

The idea behind this project is to be able to generate some
*consistent* load on the tektoncd/pipeline controller (be it with
`TaskRun` or `PipelineRun`) to be able to test how it works under
pressure and how to fiddle with different configurations to help it
perform better.
